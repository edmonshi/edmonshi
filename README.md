I'm a Software Engineering, Honours Co-op student at the University of Waterloo. I began my coding journey in 2019 through my high school’s robotics program, where I quickly fell in love with writing code and exploring its endless creative potential.
My skills in Java, C, C++ and JavaScript allowed me to create many interesting projects that can be found in my repositories. I am eager to learn new things and always on the uptake to tackle challenging problems.
